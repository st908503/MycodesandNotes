/*
event propagation-
It is that mode which determines in which order the elements recieve the event
Event bubbling- The event is first captured bu the innermost element and then propagated to outer elements
Event capturing- The event is first captured bu the outermost element and then propagated to inner elements

by default always event bubbling is done ie. innermost to outermost
